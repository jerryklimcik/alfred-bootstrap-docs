2. Click the `[ùùå]` icon

### Note

Heavily inspired by [Alfred-laravel-docs by Till Kr√ºss](https://github.com/tillkruss/alfred-laravel-docs) and big kudos to him.
The lightning fast search is powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) using the _same_ index as the official [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com) website.
